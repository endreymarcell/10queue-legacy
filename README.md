# 10queue - minimal task management

10queue is a bad pun based on "thank you".  
It is also a minimal task management app that reflects my personal needs:
- It can not hold more than ten tasks at the same time (and even ten is pushing it).
- It forgets all of them at midnight.
- It only lets you start working on the topmost item.
- It is big and colorful.
- It is fully controllable from the keyboard - press `?` to see the keyboard shortcuts.

10queue is not a backlog or even a to-do list. It's like the throw-away post-it that you use to jot down your immediate tasks - those that you are guaranteed to finish in that stint of work.

### Try it online
